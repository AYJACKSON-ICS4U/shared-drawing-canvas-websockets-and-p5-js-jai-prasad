# What I Have Learned

- When I am drawing on one p5.js canvas on my laptop, it is possible for someone else on another laptop to see that same drawing live time because of a server.

- My laptop communicates with the server with something called the "socket" (a real time connection).

- The second laptop also talks to the same server with its own socket.

- This server can be written in node.js

- "Express": a node framework/node package

- "npm init" helps install package.json. creating a json file with information about the folder

- "npm install express --save" installs express and saves express as a module that is associated with the project

- Can use brackets (Text editor) to "require" express in the project

- Can use browser ("localhost:3000") to get to index file to see what's going on.

- "static" means hosting static files, files that are not dynamic. 

- the node server is essential to host different p5 sketches.


# Still don't know 

 - I understand what node does, but what exactly is node? I think it would be interesting to know about the origin of node and more information about what it really is.
 
 - How come localhost:3000 can work for everyone's device?
 
 - I really find using a terminal or git bash interesting and how it can be used to do so many things. But one thing that I don't understand is how does it know how to do so many things? How was it programmed to be so versatile? It would be really intersting to try out.

# Creative Ideas I Might Want to Try

- In Dan Shiffman's video, he shows how the same program is being run on different tabs on the same computer. I think it would be really need to try getting it to run on different computers, maybe with a friend or family member.

- I think it would be neat to use one of our other projects that we have worked on in this course and run it with p5 on different devices simultaneously, for example, running our Flappy Bird Coding Challenge across different devices, while one person plays and the others live spectate.
