# What I Have Learned
- When I am drawing on one p5.js canvas on my laptop, it is possible for someone else on another laptop to see that same drawing live time because of a server.

- My laptop communicates with the server with something called the "socket" (a real time connection).

- The second laptop also talks to the same server with its own socket.

- This server can be written in node.js

- "Express": a node framework/node package

-"npm init" helps install package.json. creating a json file with information about the folder

-"npm install express --save" installs express and saves express as a module that is associated with the project

- Can use brackets (Text editor) to "require" express in the project

- Can use browser ("localhost:3000") to get to index file to see what's going on.

-"static" means hosting static files, files that are not dynamic.
