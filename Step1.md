# What I Have Learned
- When I am drawing on one p5.js canvas on my laptop, it is possible for someone else on another laptop to see that same drawing live time because of a server.

- My laptop communicates with the server with something called the "socket" (a real time connection).

- The second laptop also talks to the same server with its own socket.

- This server can be written in node.js
